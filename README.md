# Waving-Flag-Using-openGL

The objective of this project is to demonstrate how to do the animated, sine-wave picture.create a flag that flutters in a sine wave. Readers will see that achieving this effect is not as difficult as imagined. At least it is relatively easy to use OpenInventor ,OpenInventor is an object-oriented 3D graphics software development kit based on OpenGL. Using this development kit, programmers can quickly and concisely develop various types of interactive 3D graphics software.

## Output

A mouse click on the window or pressing the space bar toggles the flag waving ON or OFF. Press ESC at any time to exit.

## Used

freeglut

NeHe OpenGL Lesson 11: Waving Flag

A number of different sources were thoroughly searched for reference material. The major source being of our library books and the internet (numerous websites and pages including those of reputed universities and companies). Paper presentations available on the net were immense help. Previous works and ideas by seniors have been incorporated to produce this editor. Help pages provided excellent understanding of the concepts associated with C- programming.
